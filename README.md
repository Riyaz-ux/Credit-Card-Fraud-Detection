# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using Autoencoder (AE) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) models. The dataset contains credit card transactions, and the goal is to identify fraudulent activities. Autoencoder is employed for feature extraction, and t-SNE is used for visualization. The project covers data preprocessing, model development, and visualization to enhance fraud detection accuracy.
